# conda-forge documentation

## What is conda-forge?

conda-forge is a community effort and a GitHub organization which contains repositories of conda recipes and thus provides conda packages for a wide range of software.
The built distributions are uploaded to [anaconda.org/conda-forge](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge) and can be installed with [conda](https://conda.pydata.org/docs/intro.html).

**Missing a package that you would love to install with conda?**

Chances are we have already packaged it for you. You can [search](https://anaconda.org/) for packages online. Look out for packages provided by our `conda-forge` organization.

**Cannot find a package or only outdated versions of a package?** - Everybody is welcome to contribute to our package stack!

- We value all kinds of contributions â€” not just code. A few recommended ways to start contributing to conda-forge are:

    - [Contribute new packages](https://conda-forge.org/docs/maintainer/adding_pkgs.html)
    - Help update and [maintain packages](https://conda-forge.org/docs/maintainer/updating_pkgs.html#maintaining-pkgs)
    - Suggest or implement improvements for our [infrastructure](https://conda-forge.org/docs/maintainer/infrastructure.html#infrastructure)
    - Help [improve the documentation](https://conda-forge.org/docs/user/contributing.html#improve-docs)
