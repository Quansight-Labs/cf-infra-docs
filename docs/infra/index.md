# Infrastructure guide

conda-forge operates at a scale where automation is not an option.
Most processes are automated so human intervention is kept to a minimum.

In this section, we discuss:

- [Package building](/docs/infra/package-building.md): The different elements involved in each stage of the [conda packaging life cycle](/docs/user/life-cycle/index.md).
- [Feedstock maintenance](/docs/infra/feedstock-maintenance.md): Which elements keep the feedstocks working and the recipes up-to-date.
- [Security](/docs/infra/security.md): The security model in conda-forge.
