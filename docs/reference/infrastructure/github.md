# Github resources

In addition to the thousands of repositories, conda-forge uses several other Github services.

## Organizations

- [`conda-forge`](https://github.com/conda-forge): the main organization
- [`regro`](https://github.com/regro): hosts the `autotick-bot` machinery
- [`channel-mirrors`](https://github.com/channel-mirrors): OCI mirror of the conda-forge channel
